          <h3>Notes</h3>
          <p>This visualization is an attempt to rebuild a portion of '<a
              href="https://ourworldindata.org/internet">Internet</a>' by Max Roser, Hannah Ritchie and Esteban
            Ortiz-Ospina. They use data from the World Bank's '<a
              href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/it.net.user.zs">Individuals using the Internet (% of
              population)</a>' and '<a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL">Population, total</a>.'
            With this data and some fastidious palette sampling, there was a lot of success in remodeling the chart.
          </p>
          <p>The most interesting part of build was figuring out the labels for the countries and regions to the right
            of each line. There was some necessary averaging of final percentages, as well as grouping of the countries
            that fell under each percentage. But to add the countries which were in data structure <em>within</em> the
            joined data
            structure, I used the d3's
            <code><a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-selection#selection_each">selection.each(function)</a></code>. It
            allowed for me to write a function that looped through the gathered countries and append a
            <code>tspan</code> for each one
            to
            the text element. I didn't initially make much sense of it until I saw <a
              href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4c5fad723c87d2fd8273">an example</a>.
          </p>
          <p>Also, I added event listeners to the country paths so that when a path is hovered on it becomes the color
            of the region it's in. This part of the code uses a bunch of modifiers that are written in 'vanilla
            javascript' rather than using d3 event listeners and attribute methods. I'm not sure when it's better to use
            regular old JS vs. D3.js for some interactive elements.</p>
          <p>The country labels could still use some improvement. Given the margin is width, at times there is not
            enough room for all of the countries in a list for a given rounded percentage. There's problem <em>a
              lot</em> of fine tuning the code based on this particular bit and at some point I may tackle it!</p>
